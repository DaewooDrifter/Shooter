Java LIBGDX Top-Down Shooter
=============================

Grief: An Impossible Journey
--------------------

I created this top-down Shooter using java and LIBGDX. The music, soundfx and graphics are from royalty free sources listed in the credits (in-game). For those unfamiliar with Java/LIBGDX set up, the actual code is located in the directory: core / src / com / haniel / Shooter . The other main directories are for the different builds (Android / Desktop /...). The assets are located in Android / assets. I have only playtested the desktop and web builds, both of which you can play.



Current Progress
--------------------

- All 5 stages completed.
- Menu and Credits completed

To-do
--------------------
- make browser mode smoother
- harder difficulty
